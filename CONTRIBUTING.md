# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch off `main`.
2. Make focused, well-described commits.
3. Add your changes under the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Open a pull request against `main`.

## Code Style

Project-specific conventions will be documented here as they're established.

## Versioning

This project uses [Date Versioning](https://datevers.ing). To release:

1. Add a `## vYY.MM.DD` entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, with its sections in this order: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Security, Deprecated.
2. Set `VERSION.md` to the same bare version (no `v`): today's **UTC** date as `YY.MM.DD`, or `YY.MM.DD-1`, `-2`… for later releases the same UTC day. Never a future date. Use UTC, not local time: just after midnight in the UK it is still the previous day in UTC.
3. Run `bash tests/version.sh`.
4. Run `./commit.sh` (or `commit.bat` on Windows). It checks the version, commits and tags `vYY.MM.DD`, and never pushes.
